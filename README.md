# Unhorribad serve

Proudly unfancy local static file http server for shell one-liners.

# Features

- Starts a local network static file server in the current working directory.
- Simple as pie.
- It doesn't make your 4GHz quad core beast box perform worse than underclocked 80186 using a number bleeding-edge dark optimisation arts. For example:
	- Unlike a certain popular python one-liner, it doesn't block after every single trivial god damn request.
	- Unlike a certain popular npm package, it lacks a local supercluster's weight in hipster MVC framework functional monadic transpiling middleware templating caffeinated microservice San Fran /r/node corporate buzzword dependencies.
	- Unlike every god damn "news", "social networking", or corporate website, it sports a quality, Javascript-free, animation-free, bloat-free, bullshit-free, gluten-free [Motherfucking Website](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) design that shuts the fuck up, refrains from redrawing 2048 times a second, and Just Worksâ„¢.
- It doesn't break at the first sight of Unicode or "special" characters, unlike a certain Americentric npm package that has never been tested on anything more diverse than the Starbucks beverage catalogue.
- Honestly, what else do you want?

# Installation

Put it somewhere in your ```$PATH``` (probably ```/usr/local/bin```, but you know best).

# Requirements

- some relatively recent node.js version with ES6 support
- nothing else
